Hey, I'm Jason. First of all, thank you for even stopping by in the first place. It means the world to me that anyone would even check me out in the first place let alone click into my blog and read my bio. Double points if you're a hiring manager, triple if you hire me lol.

A little bit about myself here, I'm a twenty seven year old Marine Corps veteran with a background in electrical systems who is currently trying to break into a technical role. I've been programming for the better part of three to four years now and in that time I've jumped around quite a bit from starting with python to java and JS/TS, but my one true love that I have settled for is C/C++ (and python still for scripting because its basically psuedo-code lets be honest). 

I have a lot of hobbies that i try to juggle often but what has captured my attention the most as of recent has been reading sci-fi/fantasy books and working on embedded systems. I was an electrician for 3 years and found I had a knack for the craft, but left because as I moved forward in the role it became evident that the work was going to be much harder on my body than I had initially anticipated, and I wanted to find a more sustainable career opportunity, one that still Intrigued me as a concept. This led me down the path (eventually) of learning embedded systems as it was the perfect medium between building electrical systems and programming, both of which I adored.

As for the types of books I'm into, When I was a kid sci-fi and fantasy intrigued me, this fascination as I grew older led me into a borderline obsession with the world of both future and old settings of WarHammer so as you can imagine pretty much all of my reading material reflects this. I can't help it, the setting just has everything my little brain desires. 

If any of these topics interest you, I encourage you to check out my blog, where I will be doing book club style posts on books I've recently read and also posting about embedded concepts / projects I've been working on.
